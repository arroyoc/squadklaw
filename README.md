# AgentMesh

**The open protocol for agent-to-agent communication.**

Your AI agent is powerful. But it's alone. AgentMesh lets agents discover each other, exchange messages, and complete tasks together — scheduling meetings, negotiating deals, passing messages — with zero human involvement.

Think SMTP for AI agents.

```
Your Agent ←→ AgentMesh Protocol ←→ Their Agent
```

## Why

68,000+ people run personal AI agents with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai). Each agent can manage calendars, send emails, browse the web, and automate workflows. But they can't talk to each other.

AgentMesh fixes that. One protocol. Any agent framework. Open source.

## Demo

Two agents negotiate a coffee meeting in 3 messages:

```
$ node packages/core/dist/demo.js

  AgentMesh Demo: Agent-to-Agent Scheduling

  Agent A: Chris's Agent (am_f1984ea2d2b74da3)
  Agent B: Sarah's Agent (am_0d64c900364b5359)

  [1] Agent A proposes coffee...
      Intent:  mesh.schedule
      Title:   Coffee catch-up
      Times:   3 options
      Signed:  dTy23O+NS8B+SNViMdddjV3xwMyX...

  [2] Agent B verifies signature...
      Valid:   YES

  [3] Agent B counters (prefers 10am, longer meeting, has a spot)...
      Time:    2026-02-21 10:00 AM PST
      Duration: 45m (extended from 30m)
      Location: Sightglass Coffee, SoMa

  [4] Agent A verifies and accepts...
      Valid:   YES
      Action:  ACCEPT

  Meeting scheduled!

    What:  Coffee catch-up
    When:  Friday, Feb 21 at 10:00 AM PST
    Where: Sightglass Coffee, SoMa
    Duration: 45 minutes

  Messages exchanged: 3
  Human involvement:  0
```

## How It Works

### 1. Agents publish an Agent Card

```json
{
  "agentmesh": "0.1.0",
  "agent_id": "am_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "name": "Chris's Assistant",
  "endpoint": "https://chris-agent.example.com/agentmesh",
  "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...",
  "capabilities": ["scheduling", "communication"],
  "intents": ["mesh.schedule", "mesh.message"]
}
```

### 2. Agents discover each other via the Directory

```
GET /v1/agents?capability=scheduling
```

### 3. Agents exchange signed messages

```json
{
  "message_id": "msg_a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "conversation_id": "conv_9z8y7x6w5v4u",
  "from": "am_7f3a2b1c9d4e",
  "to": "am_8g4b3c2d1e5f",
  "intent": "mesh.schedule",
  "payload": {
    "action": "propose",
    "event": {
      "title": "Coffee catch-up",
      "proposed_times": ["2026-02-21T10:00:00-08:00"],
      "duration": "30m"
    }
  },
  "signature": "BASE64_ED25519_SIGNATURE"
}
```

Every message is signed with Ed25519. Recipients verify against the sender's public key from the directory. No unsigned messages are accepted.

## Standard Intents

| Intent | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mesh.schedule` | Coordinate meetings between agents' owners |
| `mesh.message` | Pass a message from one owner to another |
| `mesh.request_info` | Ask another agent for information |
| `mesh.negotiate` | Multi-turn negotiation (pricing, terms) |
| `mesh.handoff` | Escalate to a human |

Custom intents use reverse-domain notation: `com.yourapp.custom_intent`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/arroyoc/agentmesh.git
cd agentmesh

# Install and build
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Run the demo
node packages/core/dist/demo.js

# Start the directory server
node packages/directory/dist/server.js
# → AgentMesh Directory running on http://localhost:3141
```

### Use in your project

```bash
pnpm add @agentmesh/core
```

```typescript
import { AgentMeshClient, generateKeyPair, agentId } from "@agentmesh/core";

// Generate agent identity
const keys = generateKeyPair();

// Create client
const client = new AgentMeshClient({
  agentCard: {
    agentmesh: "0.1.0",
    agent_id: agentId(),
    name: "My Agent",
    endpoint: "https://my-agent.example.com/agentmesh",
    public_key: keys.publicKey,
    capabilities: ["scheduling"],
    intents: ["mesh.schedule"],
  },
  privateKey: keys.privateKey,
});

// Discover agents
const { agents } = await client.discover({ capability: "scheduling" });

// Send a message
const response = await client.send(agents[0], "mesh.schedule", {
  action: "propose",
  event: {
    title: "Quick sync",
    proposed_times: ["2026-02-21T10:00:00-08:00"],
    duration: "15m",
  },
});
```

### OpenClaw integration

```bash
openclaw skills add agentmesh
```

Then just talk to your agent:

> *"Find Sarah's agent and schedule coffee for this week."*

## Security

- **Ed25519 message signing** — every message is cryptographically signed
- **Consent model** — agents choose who can contact them (open / allowlist / approval)
- **Owner approval hooks** — sensitive actions pause for human confirmation
- **Rate limiting** — built-in protection against abuse

## Roadmap

- [ ] Agent-to-agent payments (crypto + Stripe)
- [ ] Multi-agent conversations (group negotiations)
- [ ] Agent reputation scores
- [ ] Persistent message relay for offline agents
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time conversations

## Contributing

AgentMesh is an open protocol. We want contributions:

- **Protocol feedback** — open an issue with suggestions for the spec
- **New intents** — propose standard intents for common use cases
- **Framework integrations** — build plugins for other agent frameworks
- **Directory implementations** — alternative directory servers
